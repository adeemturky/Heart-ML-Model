# Heart-ML-Model

## Results
Decision trees are simple but powerful in machine learning that can
understand complex situations and make choices based on the information they have. We
showed how to use decision trees to figure out if someone has a heart problem or not and
visualizing the resulting tree. The data we used contains numerous features crucial for diagnosis,
and about half of the cases had heart problems while the other half did not. Our model shows
promising performance, achieving an accuracy of 75%.
